# Type2Diabetes
## Project Title: Gene regulatory network associated with apoptosis in the pancreatic islets of type 2 diabetes mice.
### Motivation: This repository contains R code to normalised the gene expression data. 

It contains the following information:
1. Information about gene expression data GSE2899 available at GEO (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).
2. Metadata information "phenodata.txt".
3. R code used to normalizing the gene expression data to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
4. The list of DEGs in T2D compared with normal was identified using RankProducts.
